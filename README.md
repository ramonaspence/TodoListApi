# TodoListApi  
My first Restful API using .NET. 


# Retrospect  

* The tutorial for this can be found here: 
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1  
  
* Overall, this tutorial was not a good learning experience. Since the controller is generated, there wasn't really anything to "figure out" and therefore not much to learn from. I've decided to keep moving and work on a different ASP.NET core MVC application.  

* My experience with MVC's so far has been in Django and Rails. I can't speak on Rails too much, but in Django there's a lot of behind the scenes magic. Since I learned this way, building an API makes my mind go straight to Django Rest Framework (DRF). Django has a lot of out of the box functionality.  

* So if you asked me to build an API, I start thinking of how I do that with DRF which of course, means something entirely different in Rails or .NET (or maybe not, but the point is that it's not the same).  

# One Last Thing  

* I did use postman to test this API, which was a first for me. I'm glad that I got to be introduced to Postman as it seems to be the staple of manual API testing (and a lot more that I don't know of yet)
